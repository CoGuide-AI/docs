## Engagement analysis overview

CoGuide's engagement analysis goes beyond simple participation tracking to provide deep insights into how students engage with your classroom content. This comprehensive analysis helps you understand learning patterns, optimize teaching strategies, and create more engaging learning experiences.

<Note>
  **Engagement vs. participation**: While participation measures what students do, engagement analysis reveals how deeply they're learning and connecting with content.
</Note>
