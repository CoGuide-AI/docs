## Data protection overview

CoGuide implements comprehensive data protection measures to ensure that all classroom data is handled securely and in compliance with educational privacy regulations. Our multi-layered approach protects data at every stage of collection, processing, and storage.

<Note>
  **Security by design**: Data protection is built into every aspect of CoGuide, from initial design through ongoing operation.
