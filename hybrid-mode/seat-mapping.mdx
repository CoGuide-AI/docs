## What is seat mapping?

Seat mapping allows CoGuide to track participation by classroom location rather than individual identity. This privacy-first approach uses simple seat labels (A1, A2, B1, etc.) to provide detailed participation insights while protecting student privacy.

<Note>
  **Privacy by design**: No facial recognition is used. Participation is tied to seat locations, not student identities.
</Note>

## Why use seat mapping?

### Enhanced participation tracking
- **Individual insights**: Track participation for each seat/student
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify participation patterns across the classroom
- **Targeted support**: Identify students who may need additional engagement opportunities
- **Detailed analytics**: Get comprehensive reports on classroom participation

### Privacy protection
- **No facial recognition**: Students' faces are never analyzed or stored
- **Location-based only**: Data is tied to seat numbers, not personal identity
- **Anonymous reporting**: Analytics show participation by seat, not by name
- **Secure data**: All location data is encrypted and stored securely

## Setting up seat mapping

## Seat labeling systems

### Recommended labeling

Choose a labeling system that's easy to remember and use:

#### Row-based system (A1, A2, B1, B2...)
```
Front of room
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│ A1  │ A2  │ A3  │ A4  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ B1  │ B2  │ B3  │ B4  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ C1  │ C2  │ C3  │ C4  │
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

#### Number-based system (1, 2, 3, 4...)
```
Front of room
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  1  │  2  │  3  │  4  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  5  │  6  │  7  │  8  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  9  │ 10  │ 11  │ 12  │
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

#### Custom system
Create your own labeling that works for your classroom:
- **Subject-based**: Math1, Math2, Science1, Science2
- **Color-based**: Red1, Red2, Blue1, Blue2
- **Name-based**: Use student names (with permission)
