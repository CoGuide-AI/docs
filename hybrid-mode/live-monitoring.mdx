## Live monitoring overview

CoGuide's live monitoring provides real-time insights into classroom participation through an unobtrusive overlay that updates continuously during your class. This gives you immediate awareness of engagement patterns without disrupting your teaching flow.

## Core monitoring features

### Hand raise detection

CoGuide automatically detects and counts students with raised hands in real-time.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Detection accuracy" icon="target">
    **High precision**: Advanced computer vision identifies hand-raising gestures
    - Works with various hand positions and angles
    - Adapts to different lighting conditions
    - Filters out false positives from normal movement
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Live counter" icon="calculator">
    **Instant updates**: Real-time count of students with hands raised
    - Updates immediately when hands go up or down
    - Persistent count throughout the class
    - Visual indicator shows current number
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Talk time tracking

Separate monitoring of teacher and student speaking time provides insights into classroom dynamics.

#### Teacher talk time
- **Speaking duration**: Total time you spend talking
- **Percentage tracking**: Your talk time as percentage of total class time
- **Visual meter**: Real-time indicator of your speaking time
- **Balance alerts**: Notifications when teacher talk time exceeds recommended levels

#### Student talk time
- **Collective tracking**: Total time all students spend speaking
- **Individual contributions**: Time each student participates (when using seat mapping)
- **Response patterns**: Analysis of student speaking distribution
- **Engagement indicators**: Visual cues for student participation levels

### Turn tracking

Monitor student participation opportunities and response patterns.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Turn detection">
    CoGuide identifies when students respond to questions or participate in discussions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Turn counting">
    Each student response is counted and tracked throughout the class.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pattern analysis">
    The system identifies participation patterns and frequency.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Visual feedback">
    Turn counts are displayed in the live overlay for immediate awareness.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Wait time monitoring

Track response times after questions to improve classroom pacing.

#### Automatic detection
- **Question identification**: Detects when you ask questions
- **Response timing**: Measures time until first student responds
- **Extended wait alerts**: Notifies you when wait times exceed thresholds
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies questions that consistently have long wait times

#### Visual indicators
- **Timer display**: Shows elapsed time since last question
- **Color coding**: Green for normal wait times, yellow for extended, red for very long
- **Alert notifications**: Visual and optional audio alerts for extended wait times

## Overlay interface

### Main display elements

The live monitoring overlay shows key metrics in a compact, customizable format:

## Advanced features

### Real-time alerts

Configure alerts to help you maintain optimal classroom dynamics:

#### Talk time balance
- **Teacher dominance**: Alert when you're talking too much
- **Student engagement**: Notify when student participation is low
- **Balance recommendations**: Suggestions for improving participation balance

#### Wait time management
- **Extended silence**: Alert when wait times exceed your threshold
- **Question effectiveness**: Identify questions that consistently have long wait times
- **Pacing guidance**: Recommendations for better question timing

#### Participation patterns
- **Dominant speakers**: Identify students who participate excessively
- **Quiet students**: Flag students who haven't participated recently
- **Engagement drops**: Alert when overall participation decreases

### Integration with seat mapping

When using seat mapping, live monitoring provides location-specific insights:

- **Seat-based tracking**: See which specific seats are participating
- **Participation heatmap**: Visual representation of engagement by location
- **Individual metrics**: Track participation for each seat/student
- **Pattern analysis**: Identify participation patterns across the classroom

## Best practices for live monitoring

### Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start simple">
    Begin with basic metrics (hand raises, talk time) before adding advanced features.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Position carefully">
    Place the overlay where it's visible but doesn't obstruct important content.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor gradually">
    Check metrics occasionally rather than constantly to avoid distraction.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjust settings">
    Fine-tune alerts and thresholds based on your teaching style and class dynamics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Effective use during class

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Questioning">
    - Use wait time alerts to improve question pacing
    - Monitor hand raises to gauge question difficulty
    - Track response patterns to identify effective questioning techniques
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Discussion management">
    - Balance teacher and student talk time for better engagement
    - Use turn tracking to ensure all students have opportunities to participate
    - Monitor participation patterns to guide discussion flow
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Classroom management">
    - Use hand raise counts to manage response order
    - Monitor engagement levels to adjust lesson pace
    - Track participation to identify students who may need support
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Interpreting the data

<Note>
  **Remember**: Live monitoring provides awareness, not judgment. Use insights to improve your teaching, not to evaluate students.
</Note>

#### Key indicators to watch
- **Hand raise frequency**: High numbers may indicate engaging content or unclear instructions
- **Talk time balance**: Aim for 60-70% student talk time in discussion-based classes
- **Wait time patterns**: Consistent long waits may indicate questions that are too difficult
- **Turn distribution**: Uneven participation may suggest need for different engagement strategies

## Troubleshooting live monitoring
