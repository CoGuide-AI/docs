## What is Standby Mode?

CoGuide Standby is your silent classroom companion that watches and listens while you stay in charge. It runs in observation mode so you can focus on teachingâ€”no prompts, no cold calls, only awareness.

<Note>
  **Key principle**: Standby mode is observation-only. It provides awareness without disrupting your teaching flow.
</Note>

## How Standby works

Standby mode operates in the background, providing real-time insights through a small, unobtrusive overlay that shows:

### Live participation metrics

### Teaching with awareness

Standby mode enhances your teaching by providing:

- **Participation balance**: See if you're talking too much or too little
- **Engagement patterns**: Identify which students participate most/least
- **Question effectiveness**: Track response times to gauge question clarity
- **Class dynamics**: Understand participation flow and timing

## Privacy and control

### Data handling
- **Local processing**: All analysis happens on your device
- **No cloud storage**: Data stays in your classroom unless you choose to sync
- **Teacher control**: You decide when to start and stop monitoring

### Student privacy
- **No facial recognition**: Only tracks participation by seat location
- **Anonymous data**: Individual participation is tied to seat numbers, not identities
- **Secure storage**: All data encrypted and stored according to your school's policies

<Warning>
  **Important**: Always inform students and parents about classroom monitoring and obtain necessary permissions according to your school's policies.
