description: "How CoGuide protects student privacy and keeps data secure"
---

## Privacy-first design

CoGuide is built with privacy and security as fundamental principles. We believe that classroom technology should enhance learning without compromising student privacy or creating security risks.

<Note>
  **Core principle**: Your school owns the data. CoGuide processes it securely and never uses it for purposes beyond improving classroom engagement.
</Note>

## Data protection framework

### What data we collect

CoGuide collects only the minimum data necessary to provide classroom insights:

#### Participation data
- **Hand raise events**: When students raise their hands (no facial recognition)
- **Speaking patterns**: Voice activity and timing (no voice recording or storage)
- **Seat participation**: Which seats participate (when using seat mapping)
- **Response timing**: When students respond to questions

#### What we don't collect
- **Facial images**: No facial recognition or facial data collection
- **Voice recordings**: No audio recording or voice storage
- **Personal information**: No names, student IDs, or identifying details
- **Biometric data**: No fingerprint, face, or other biometric information
- **Location data**: No GPS or location tracking beyond classroom seat positions

### Data processing and storage

  <Card title="Local processing" icon="laptop">
    **On-device analysis**
    - All analysis happens on your classroom device
    - No data sent to external servers during class
    - Real-time processing for immediate insights
    - Complete privacy during active monitoring
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="School-owned storage" icon="building">
    **Your school controls data**

</Columns>

## Privacy protection measures

### No facial recognition

CoGuide explicitly does not use facial recognition technology:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Computer vision only">
    Uses computer vision to detect hand-raising gestures and general classroom activity.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="No face analysis">
    Never analyzes, stores, or processes facial images or biometric data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Gesture detection">
    Focuses only on detecting participation gestures like raised hands.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Anonymous tracking">
    All participation data is tied to seat locations, not individual identities.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Seat mapping privacy

When using seat mapping, privacy is maintained through location-based tracking:

#### Anonymous participation
- **Seat numbers only**: Participation tied to A1, A2, B1, etc., not student names
- **No identity linking**: Seat numbers are not linked to student identities
- **Pattern analysis**: Focus on participation patterns, not individual students
- **Aggregate reporting**: Analytics show classroom trends, not individual performance

#### Data minimization
- **Essential data only**: Collect only participation timing and frequency
- **No personal details**: No names, photos, or identifying information
- **Temporary storage**: Data kept only as long as needed for analysis
- **Automatic purging**: Old data automatically deleted according to retention policies

### Voice and audio privacy

CoGuide processes voice data for participation tracking without recording or storing audio:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real-time processing">
    - Voice data processed in real-time for participation detection
    - No audio recording or storage

    - No voice recognition or identification
    - Complete audio privacy maintained
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security measures
