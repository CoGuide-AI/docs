## What you'll see during class

CoGuide Standby provides a small, unobtrusive overlay showing:

- **Hand raises**: Live count of students with hands up
- **Talk time**: Separate meters for teacher and student speaking time
- **Turns**: Number of student participation opportunities
- **Wait time**: Duration after questions before responses

<Note>
  **No disruption**: Standby mode is observation-only. No prompts, no cold calls, just awareness.
